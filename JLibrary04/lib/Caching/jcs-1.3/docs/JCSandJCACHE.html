        The JCS is an attempt to build a system close to JCACHE , <a href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/107.jsp" class="externalLink" title="External Link">JSR-107</a>, a
        description of the caching system used in Oracle9i.  JCS grew
        out of my work over the past two years to build an enterprise
        level caching system.  Though it is replete with good ideas,
        there are some aspects of the JCACHE architecture that could
        lead to inefficiency (ex, the lateral distribution and net
        searches) and a few programming preferences that I found
        cumbersome (ex, the use of exceptions to report the common
        place).  Subsequently there are a few differences between the
        two systems.  In some cases I have moved my original system
        closer to the JCACHE model where it presented a better idea.
        Briefly:
      </p><div class="subsection"><a name="Element_vs__Region_Attributes"></a><h3>Element vs. Region Attributes</h3><p>
          My original cache was regionally defined.  Each entry required
          a very minimal wrapper.  The osc4j specification is an element
          driven model where each element is fully configurable.  This
          could lead to a slight performance penalty, but it is a richer
          model, where elements can inherit or have their own
          attributes.  So, I converted the entire system into element
          centered framework.
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Lateral_Broadcast_vs__Remote_Consistency"></a><h3>Lateral Broadcast vs. Remote Consistency</h3><p>
          The oracle model is a laterally distributed framework with no
          centralized control.  The JCS model has the option for lateral
          broadcast (which will need to be made more efficient) and a
          remote store that coordinates consistency. In the JCS Local
          caches send data to the remote store which then notifies other
          local caches of changes to "regions" (caches) that are
          registered.  In JCACHE's lateral model an update is never
          broadcast from the remote, rather updates come via the lateral
          caches.  If you broadcast changes to all servers then every
          server must be ready for every user.  The usage patterns of a
          user on one box can affect the whole.  Also, the lateral model
          can make it difficult to synchronize combinations of updates
          and invalidations.
        </p><p>
          With a remote store the local caches are primed to take on
          similar patterns by talking to the remote store, but aren't
          flooded with the elements from another machine.  This
          significantly cuts down on traffic.  This way each local cache
          is a relatively separate realm with remotely configurable
          regions that stay in synch without overriding the user habits
          of any machine.  It also allows for an efficient mechanism of
          retrieval, where searching for an element involves, at
          maximum, only as many steps as there are remote servers in the
          cluster.  In the lateral model a failed net search could take
          an extremely long time to complete, making it necessary for
          the programmer to decide how long of a wait is acceptable.
        </p><p>
          Though this is by and large a poor model, the JCS will include
          the ability to perform full lateral searches.  A more
          important feature is remote failover and remote server
          clustering.  With clustering any concerns about the remote
          server being a single point of failure vanish and the remote
          server model is significantly more robust.
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Put_vs__Replace"></a><h3>Put vs. Replace</h3><p>
          The difference between put and replace is not present in the
          JCS by default.  The overhead associated with this distinction
          is tremendous.  However, there will be an alternate "safe-put"
          method to deal with special caches.
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Nulls_vs__Errors"></a><h3>Nulls vs. Errors</h3><p>
          I started to support <code>ObjectNotFoundExceptions</code> for
          failed gets but the overhead and cumbersome coding needed to
          surround a simple get method is ridiculous.  Instead the JCS
          returns null.
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Cache_Loaders"></a><h3>Cache Loaders</h3><p>
          I'm not supporting cache loaders at this time.  They seem
          unnecessary, but may be useful in a smart portal.
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Groups_vs__Hierarchy"></a><h3>Groups vs. Hierarchy</h3><p>
          The JCS provides feature rich grouping mechanism, where groups
          of elements can be invalidated and whose attributes can be
          listed.  The grouping feature is much like the session API.
          In addition, the JCS provides a mechanism for hierarchical
          removal without the overhead of keeping track of all the
          elements of a group across machines.  Element keys with
          "<code>:</code>" separators (a value that will be fully
          configurable) can be arranged in a hierarchy.  A remove
          command ending in a "<code>:</code>" will issue a removal of
          all child elements.  I can associate search and menu drop down
          lists for a particular company in a multi-company system by
          starting each key in disparate caches with the company id
          followed by "<code>:</code>" and then the normal key.
          Invalidating this data when a change is made to data affecting
          something falling under that company can be removed by simply
          calling <code>cacheAccess.remove(comp_id + ":")</code>.
